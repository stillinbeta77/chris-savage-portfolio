    <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
    <p>I was born in Chicago, Illinois and moved to the San Fernando Valley in California when I was two years old. I lived in California until I was 18. I joined the Navy at 18 and was stationed in Seattle, WA for 5 years. After living in Seattle for 14 years, my wife and I moved to Arizona to enjoy the golf and sun.</p>
